      <p class="paragraph">
        Hello, my name is <b>Sion Sak</b>. I am originally from the beautiful
        Siem Reap province in Cambodia, a place well-known for its rich cultural
        heritage and the stunning temples of Angkor Wat. Growing up in such a
        historically significant area has inspired me to think creatively and
        work hard toward building something meaningful. Currently, I am pursuing
        my studies at PSBU, where I am deepening my knowledge and skills in
        technology and development. I am passionate about programming and have
        chosen to focus my career on web development. Designing and building
        websites that are not only functional but also user-friendly and
        visually appealing is something I truly enjoy. As a web developer, I
        work with a variety of programming languages and frameworks to bring
        ideas to life on the internet. Whether it’s creating a personal
        portfolio, an e-commerce platform, or a responsive business site, I take
        pride in writing clean, efficient code that helps users have a seamless
        experience. I believe technology can change lives, and I’m excited to be
        a part of that change. I’m always eager to learn new things, collaborate
        with others, and continue growing both personally and professionally in
        the tech world.
